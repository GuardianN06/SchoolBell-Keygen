# SchoolBell-Keygen

This repository contains a proof of concept for a key generator targeting the SchoolBell application by ktims.com. SchoolBell is designed to manage school bell systems, and this key generator serves as an educational tool to demonstrate key generation techniques.

The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the mechanisms of software licensing and security. It is intended strictly for educational use and not for circumventing the purchase of legitimately licensed software. Users are encouraged to respect the softwareâ€™s licensing agreement and to purchase a license if they choose to use the product.

A valid activation code alongside the username is found in the validuserkey.txt file to immediately activate without brute-forcing.
